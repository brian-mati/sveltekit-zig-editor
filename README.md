## Why sveltekit?

I use sveltekit as my Js framework of choice.So i thought why not build a project around it while learning low level programming(I'll probably regret this).Anyway thats the reason.

> **I need smth i can concentrate on without getting bored** and a simple todo app just would not cut it.

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. Have a GUI(Graphical User Interface) to display my code.

2. Provide a system file tree to view the various files created
3. Have syntax highlighting and debugging suite such code documentation on hover

4. Provide ease of use utilities for sveltekit listed below(This is subject to change ... lol )

   - A preview view routes created
   - A utility to check if packages such as (tailwind,drizzle and the node-adapter used are installed)

5. Support for markdown
